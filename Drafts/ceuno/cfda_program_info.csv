"122",122,"10.500","Cooperative Extension Service","(CES)","GENERAL: [As reflected in Part I,B. of the Request for Applications (RFA) or Capacity Requests for Applications (Capacity RFA)]
1. Smith-Lever (3b) & (c) Capacity Grants (formerly known as Formula Funds)

a)  Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (formerly known as 3b & c Formula Funds)  
These funds are used by institutions eligible to receive funds under the Act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled \x91\x91An Act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts\x92\x92 (Twelfth Statutes at Large, page five hundred and three) (\x931862 Land-grant Institutions\x94), for the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and subjects relating thereto to persons not attending or resident in 1862 Land-grant Institutions in the several communities, and imparting information on those subjects through demonstrations, publications, and otherwise and for the necessary printing and distribution of information in connection with the subjects.
The purpose of this funding is to conduct agricultural extension work.

(b)  Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (Special Needs) \x96  
The purpose of this funding is to increase the level of agricultural extension work. These funds are used to support extension activities identified in the eligible institution\x92s approved 5-Year Plan of Work. Special Needs funds are allocated to a State Cooperative Extension Service to fulfill a purpose or overcome a condition peculiar to the State, as compared to the country as a whole, or for a purpose not normally a part of the continuing extension program.

(c) Smith-Lever Special Needs Program  
Funds support innovative extension education approaches to addressing risks, hazards and disasters. The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests.

There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. 

Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. 

The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 

1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 

2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 

3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 

4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users\x92 needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 

5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 

6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs (e.g., the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and etc\x85) and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. 

Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 

1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 

2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 

3. Develop community networks that provide real-time disaster education information; and/or 

4. Develop or expand educational materials regarding disaster issues suitable for use and distribution by the Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) or the eXtension Community of Practice working with disaster planning.

Each of these surveillance systems and surveys is funded by a government agency, and each collects detailed data on the breadth and depth of existing state laws, district policies, and related school practices; the implementation of said laws, policies, and practices; and their effects on student health outcomes. The next section describes the strengths, primary areas of focus, periodicity, and other key characteristics for each of three major national surveillance systems and surveys. In so doing, it also highlights important gaps in what they cover, individually and collectively, and areas where linkage with other relevant surveys or research efforts would provide a more detailed picture of school wellness policies and their effects.

1. School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study/School Nutrition Dietary Assessment
The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment (SNDA) is administrated by the USDA\x92s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) every 5 years and collects and analyzes nationally representative data on school meals and the school meal environment (including competitive foods) at the district- and school-levels, with individual-level dietary information collected every 10 years.14 SNDA-V will be administered as the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) in SY 2014-2015 and will include SNDA-type, meal assessment data as well as data on meal cost, dietary recall, plate waste, and meals\x92 compliance with standards.

SNDA/SNMCS is the only assessment that examines specifically the nutritional quality of school meals, how and if those meals are meeting the new standards, and meal cost. Examining SNDA/SNMCS data together with state law and district policy data, which SNDA does not currently collect, has the potential to demonstrate how the laws and policies at the state- and district-level are being implemented in, or affecting, lunchrooms (with regard to meal planning and meal environment) and students (with regard to meal cost and diet).

2. Classification of Laws Associated with School Students
The National Cancer Institute\x92s Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (C.L.A.S.S.) is a policy classification system that can be used to evaluate state-level codified laws for nutrition and physical education in schools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia by grade level. C.L.A.S.S. uses state law as the data source and scores the concordance between state laws and national school wellness policy mandates. Currently, C.L.A.S.S. measures are collected annually, with the next cycle beginning in 2014. C.L.A.S.S. data are publicly available for use by researchers, policy makers, and school administrators to obtain information on state laws associated with childhood obesity, track policy changes over time, test relationships between law and behavior, associate C.L.A.S.S. scores with state- and school district-policies, and link to information about obesity and other cancer-related behaviors. C.L.A.S.S. also offers two data visualization tools: (1) a map function that depicts the strength of specific policy areas by grade level across states, and (2) a profile function that depicts policy scores across grade levels within each state by year.

While C.L.A.S.S. is the only classification system that objectively scores state laws on nutritional and physical activity, it does not identify specific elements of the state laws. Therefore, additional, complementary research is required to parse out and examine relationships between individual policy components (e.g., addressing sugar or fat content in school foods) and related school practices and student outcomes (e.g., diet, physical activity, BMI).

3.  School Health Policies and Practices Study
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\x92s School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) is a national, comprehensive survey conducted to assess school wellness at the state-, district-, school-, and classroom-levels. SHPPS surveys cover health education, physical education, health services, mental health and social services, nutrition services, healthy and safe school environments, and faculty and staff health promotion. Due to the comprehensive design of SHPPS, wellness policy data may be linked with other school health data. SHPPS data are collected every two years, alternating school- and classroom-level data collection with district-level data collection. In its next cycle (2014), SHPPS will collect school- and classroom-level data, and in the following cycle (2016) it will collect district-level data. Beginning in 2016, SHPPS will no longer collect state-level data.

SHPPS is unique in monitoring both school health policies and school wellness policies, which is essential for linking LWPs to student health outcomes such as services received, safety, and environments. The multi-level aspect of SHPPS assessments presents the opportunity for linking this data with state law data in order to show the effects of state laws on LWPs, and the effects of LWPs on overall health. However, SHPPS data are not collected annually. 

Great progress has been made in adopting school wellness policies and in developing surveillance systems to monitor their implementation and impact. Yet continued progress in school wellness, school wellness policy development, and positive impacts will require surveillance that provides a fuller understanding of the strengths and limitations of current policies, and that chart the course for evidence-based improvements. This competitive cooperative agreement solicits applications for a national-level surveillance system that will address the most important gaps in the coverage of the existing school wellness policy surveillance systems and surveys. Applicants seeking funding under this School Wellness Policy Cooperative Agreement should consider, at a minimum, the following specific capabilities when developing their proposals:
\x95	The capability to link enacted school district wellness policy and related state law data with data being collected through other existing surveillance systems (e.g., SNDA, CLASS, SHPPS) in 2014-2015 (i.e., data collection occurring at various levels as outlined above);
\x95	The capability to conduct a nationwide evaluation of the scope of \x93on-the-books\x94 (enacted) school district wellness policies and related state laws;
\x95	The ability to collect and analyze qualitative data that can explore the implementation of and compliance with HHFKA policies across various stakeholders (e.g., administrators, school food authorities, parents, children, etc.);
\x95	The capacity to develop and disseminate timely policy briefs, fact sheets, and other translation products (e.g., infographics) to inform the USDA, Congress, and the research field of key school wellness policy surveillance results and gaps as well as to produce papers for peer-reviewed publication; and

The focus of single or multiple-entity agency funding for the winning proposal(s) should be minimally to compile \x93on-the-books\x94 wellness policy data for a nationally representative sample of public school districts and concomitant state laws using an innovative approach that encompasses the above-listed potential areas of focus and other policy opportunities. The Grantees (Recipients) shall work cooperatively with FNS on the study design and evaluation.","No Data Available"

To facilitate CEDS, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to the designated planning organization (e.g., District Organization) serving EDA-designated Economic Development Districts (EDDs) throughout the Nation.  These planning organizations are typically recognized by the State in which they reside as multi-jurisdictional councils of governments, regional commissions, or planning and development centers.  Partnership Planning grants enable planning organizations to manage and coordinate the development and implementation of CEDS.  In addition, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to Indian Tribes to help organize and assist with the implementation of economic development activities within their areas.  The majority of funding under the Planning program is for Partnership Planning grants for Indian Tribes and EDA-designated EDDs.

"950",950,"16.812","Second Chance Act Reentry Initiative","Second Chance Act (SCA)","There are currently over 2.2 million individuals serving time in federal and state prisons, and millions of people cycle through local jails every year. Of those in state and federal prison, approximately 95 percent will be released and return to communities across the nation. A majority of these individuals have needs that, if unaddressed in prison, during the reentry process, and after release, will negatively impact their ability to live productive, pro-social, crime-free lives in the community. These needs include housing and employment challenges, relationship and family issues, and substance abuse and mental health problems.

The Second Chance Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-199) helps to address these significant challenges by providing comprehensive responses to the significant number of incarcerated adults who are returning to communities from prison, jail, and juvenile residential facilities. Programs funded under the Second Chance Act help to promote public safety by ensuring that the transition individuals make from prison and jail to the community is successful.

"951",951,"16.813","NICS Act Record Improvement Program","(NARIP)","To improve the FBI\x92s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by providing assistance to states to improve the completeness, automation and transmittal to state and federal systems the records utilized by the NICS. Such records include criminal history records, records of felony convictions, warrants, records of protective orders, convictions for misdemeanor involving domestic violence and stalking, records of mental health adjudications, and others, which may disqualify an individual from possessing or receiving a firearm under federal law. Helping states to automate these records will also reduce delays for law-abiding gun purchasers. 

The NICS Improvement Act amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (\x93the Brady Act\x94) (Public Law 103-159), under which the Attorney General established NICS. The Brady Act requires Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to contact the NICS before transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person for information on whether the proposed transferee is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under state or federal law. The NICS Improvement Act was enacted in the wake of the April 2007 shooting tragedy at Virginia Tech. The Virginia Tech shooter was able to purchase firearms from an FFL because information about his prohibiting mental health history was not available to the NICS and the system was therefore unable to deny the transfer of the firearms used in the shootings. 

The Act seeks to address the gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments and other prohibiting backgrounds. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms. 

The Act authorized two grant programs to assist states in providing certain information to the NICS, and prescribes grant penalties for non-compliance with the Act\x92s record completeness goals. Pursuant to the Act, there are certain conditions, described below, that a state must satisfy in advance of receiving grants under the Act. The NICS Improvement Act has provisions that require states to meet specified goals for completeness of the records submitted to the Attorney General on individuals prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms. The records covered include automated information needed by the NICS to identify felony convictions, felony indictments, fugitives from justice, drug arrests and convictions, prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments, domestic violence protection orders, and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. 

The Act provides for a number of incentives for states to meet the goals it sets for greater record completeness. First, the Act allows states to obtain a waiver, beginning in 2011, of the state matching requirement under the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) grant program, if a state provides at least 90 percent of its records identifying persons in specified prohibited categories. Second, the Act authorizes grant programs described herein, which, pursuant to the Act, are being administered consistent with NCHIP, for state executive and judicial agencies to establish and upgrade information automation and identification technologies for timely submission of final criminal record dispositions and other information relevant to NICS checks. Finally, the Act provides for discretionary and mandatory Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program grant penalties, beginning 3 years after enactment, for non-compliance with specified record completeness requirements within certain timeframes: after 3 years, 3 percent may be withheld in the case of less than 50 percent completeness; after 5 years, 4 percent may be withheld in the case of less than 70 percent completeness; and after 10 years, 5 percent shall be withheld in the case of less than 90 percent completeness (although the mandatory reduction can be waived if there is substantial evidence of the state making a reasonable effort to comply).","http://bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=49"

Child victims of or witnesses to violence may suffer devastating consequences beyond physical harm, which may include attachment difficulties, regressive behavior, anxiety, depression, and aggression. When these problems go unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure, substance abuse, repeat victimization, delinquency, gang involvement, and criminal behavior during adulthood. In short, mitigating children\x92s exposure to violence is central to breaking the cycle of violence. 

The Children Exposed to Violence program builds on and incorporates the knowledge gained through research, programs, and demonstration initiatives that have addressed the problem of children exposed to violence over the past decade. The Program features a comprehensive effort to identify successful policies and practices that address the trauma and harm that children exposed to violence experience in their homes, communities, and schools. The Program supports prevention, intervention, treatment, and community organizing strategies to implement a comprehensive continuum of care for children and teens, from birth through age 17, which have been exposed to violence. The ultimate goals of the Children Exposed to Violence Program is to reduce the severity of violence, reduce the frequency of violence, reduce the short- and long-term traumatic impact of violence, increase community safety and accountability, improve the response to children exposed to violence, improve the safety and well-being of children, and create a national dialogue on the issue of children exposed to violence.","http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org"

Recognizing their sacrifice, Congress enacted laws to prevent veterans seeking Federal employment from being penalized for their time in military service. Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans.  Veterans' preference is not so much a reward for being in uniform as it is a way to help make up for the economic loss suffered by those who answered the nation's call to arms. Historically, preference has been reserved by Congress for those who were either disabled or who served in combat areas. Eligible veterans receive many advantages in Federal employment, including preference for initial employment and a higher retention standing in the event of layoffs. However, the veterans' preference laws do not guarantee the veteran a job, nor do they give veterans' preference in internal agency actions such as promotion, transfer, reassignment, and reinstatement. By law, veterans who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are entitled to preference over others in hiring from competitive lists of eligibles and also in retention during reductions-in-force. Preference applies in hiring for virtually all Federal jobs, whether in the competitive or excepted service.  In addition to receiving preference in competitive appointments, veterans may be considered for special noncompetitive appointments for which only they are eligible.","http://www.dol.gov/dol/vets/public/programs/programs/preference/main.htm"

"1051",1051,"19.026","Global Peace Operations Initiative ","GPOI","GPOI was initially envisioned as a five-year program (FY 2005-2009) to help address major gaps in international capacity to conduct peace support operations (PSOs), with a focus on Africa.  Such gaps included a shortage of capable peacekeepers and formed police units (FPUs), limited national capabilities to train and sustain peacekeeping proficiencies, and a lack of international coordination mechanisms to assist the deployment of troop and police contingents to PSOs.  Despite considerable progress in these areas since FY 2005, significant capacity shortfalls continue to impact the effectiveness of United Nations (UN) and regional PSOs.  Addressing these gaps will require a long-term commitment to capacity building by the United States and other contributor countries.  Toward this end, a National Security Council Deputies Committee approved a five-year renewal of GPOI\x92s mandate (FY 2010-2014) in October 2008.  Through policy statements and budgetary allocations, the current Administration subsequently affirmed support for the continuation of PSO capacity building activities through GPOI.

Reflective of global PSO requirements at the time of GPOI\x92s establishment, the program\x92s first five years focused on significantly increasing the number of peacekeepers available for deployment.  Accordingly, the primary objective of \x93Phase I\x94 was to train and, as appropriate, equip at least 75,000 peacekeepers by 2010.  GPOI met and, in fact, surpassed this target, training 86,969 peacekeepers as of 30 September 2009.  Through GPOI, the United States further provides deployment support, obligating $ 76.6 million to date to facilitate the equipping, transportation, and sustainment of troops deploying to various UN and regional missions.  Overall, GPOI train, equip, and deployment support activities have facilitated the deployment of 122,202 personnel from 31 countries to 19 PSOs around the world.

GPOI funds a wide range of regional capacity building initiatives, to include technical assistance, staff training, equipment provisions, and building refurbishments for two regional headquarters (the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)) and 32 national and regional PSO training centers.  Additionally, GPOI provides financial, technical, and staffing support to the Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (COESPU), an Italian-led center to facilitate the training of stability/formed police unit (FPU) trainers.  


During \x93Phase II\x94 (FY 2010-2014), GPOI will seek to continue to ensure sufficient numbers of capable peacekeepers are available for PSOs, with the target of facilitating training for an additional 242,500 troops.  However, program emphasis has shifted from the direct training of peacekeepers by U.S. personnel to building sustainable, indigenous PSO training capabilities in partner countries/ organizations.  GPOI-funded activities emphasize the establishment and strengthening of partner countries\x92 training infrastructures, with a focus on both military troops and FPUs, where appropriate.  Accordingly, at least two-thirds (or approximately 162,500) of the peacekeepers trained will be trained indigenously by GPOI-trained instructors.  GPOI will further continue to serve as a mechanism for supporting units deploying to UN and regional peacekeeping missions, as well as to build the capacity of regional organizations to train for, plan, deploy, manage, sustain, and integrate lessons learned from PSOs.","No Data Available"

The National Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program aims to work aggressively to reduce the pollution emitted from diesel engines across the country through the implementation of varied control strategies and involvement of national, state, and local partners. Priority shall be given to projects which achieve significant reductions in diesel emissions in terms of tons of pollution produced by diesel engines and diesel emissions exposure, particularly from fleets operating at or servicing goods movement facilities located in areas designated as having poor air quality. Further, priority for funding may be given to projects which result in outcomes that benefit affected communities, those that engage local communities with respect to the design and performance of the project, and those which can demonstrate the ability to promote and continue efforts to reduce emissions after the project has ended. Poor air quality areas include areas in nonattainment or maintenance of national ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 and Ozone, and areas with toxic air pollutant concerns. In FY 2017, projects will likely be competed and funded under the Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program FY 2017 Request for Proposals, and the Tribal Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program FY 2017 Request for Proposals. Clean Diesel Emerging Technologies Program grants and SmartWay Clean Diesel Finance Program grants will likely not be funded in FY2017.","http://www.epa.gov/cleandiesel "

This program has the following main objectives:

First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest priority work as articulated in biennial updates to the Action Agenda work plan. The updated biennial work plan identifies specific near term actions to achieve reductions in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Biennial Science Work plan which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed in order for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is to support implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical studies and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities. 


Second, the Scientific Studies and Technical Investigations awards through this program will help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management of the program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of Puget Sound by 2020.


Specific areas of focus for Puget Sound protection and restoration were identified in 2010 as Toxics and Nutrients, Pathogens, Marine Nearshore, Watershed Protection, and Management of Implementation of the Action Agenda.

"1431",1431,"66.456","National Estuary Program","(NEP)","The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect and restore the water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated watersheds designated by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance. The 28 estuaries of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed, develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners, including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands; supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing strategies to provide opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served communities to have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational activities

Funding Priority -  - Fiscal Year 2016: EPA's funding priority is to award assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs' (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds' priority problems identified in each of the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address priority problems identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments and environmental results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) need to assess risks to CCMP implementation due to climate change impacts, to build regional, local, and tribal officials' capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community resilience; activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments of communities and local development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and programs; and 4) need to build the capacity of local public officials and managers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices.","http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/nep/index.cfm"

Funding Priority - Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2016: Capitalization grants are available to each State for the purpose of establishing a Clean Water SRF for providing assistance for: (1) construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment works; (2) implementing nonpoint source management activities included in State Plans developed pursuant to Section 319; and (3) developing and implementing an estuary comprehensive conservation and management plan under Section 320. The 2014 Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) included amendments to the Clean Water SRF. The amendments included additional types of assistance available in the SRF, changed the amount of funding that is available for administering the SRF and provided the opportunity for States to offer additional subsidy. In addition to the assistance mentioned above, SRF may now provide assistance for:(1) the construction, repair, or replacement of decentralized wastewater treatment systems that treat municipal wastewater or domestic sewage; (2) measures to manage, reduce, treat or recapture stormwater or subsurface drainage water; (3) any municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency for measures to reduce the demand for publicly owned treatment works capacity through water conservation, efficiency or reuse; (4) the development and implementation of watershed projects meeting the criteria set forth in section 122; (5) any municipality or interrmunicipal, interstate, or State agency for measures to reduce the energy consumption needs for publicly owned treatment works; (6) reusing or recycling wastewater, stormwater, or subsurface drainage water; (7) measures to increase the security of publicly owned treatment works; and (8) any qualified nonprofit entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to owners and operators of small and medium publicly owned treatment works. The capitalization grant is deposited in the State's SRF, which is used to provide loans and other types of financial assistance, to local communities and intermunicipal and interstate agencies. 4 percent of the grant amounts, $400,000 each year or 1/5 percent per year of the current valuation (net profit) of the fund may be used by the States for the cost of administering the SRF. States determine priorities for funding within their State in accordance with the CWA. A portion of the funding must be used to provide additional subsidy in the form of grants, principal forgiveness or negative interest loans. The maximum percentage that may be provided as additional subsidy will range from 0 percent to 30 percent based on the amount of the total appropriation. For example, if the total appropriation is less than or equal to $1 billion, no additional subsidy would be authorized; if the total appropriation is greater than or equal to $1.3 billion, additional subsidy up to 30 percent of the grant would be authorized; but, if the total appropriation is greater than $1 billion but less than $1.3 billion, a percentage equal to the percentage by which the appropriation exceeds $1 billion would be authorized. Additional subsidy may only be provided to a municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency and used to benefit a municipality who meets the SRF affordability criteria, benefits individual ratepayers in residential user rate class or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology to address water efficiency goals, energy efficiency goals, mitigate stormwater runoff or encourage sustainable project planning, design and construction. In addition to the above, the FY 2016 Appropriation required that ten percent of the capitalization grant be used as additional subsidy in the form of principal forgiveness, negative interest or grants.

To expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay. EPA's funding priority is to achieve the goals and commitments established in the Chesapeake 2000 agreement and the final coordinated strategy under Executive Order (EO) 13508. As a means to achieve the goals and commitments, assistance agreements are awarded to: nonprofit organizations, State and local governments, colleges, universities, and interstate agencies. The type of projects that are awarded range from monitoring to environmental education. These projects have helped support the commitments set forth in Chesapeake Executive Council agreements and amendments (The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983 through Chesapeake 2000) and subsequent directives, adoption statements, endorsements and resolutions. 
Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2016: EPA's focus in FY 2016 is to continue to improve the rate of progress in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by meeting the President's expectations as described in Executive Order (EO) 13508, using the Agency's existing statutory authority, implementing the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), providing states with the tools necessary for effective regulatory implementation, creating better tools for scientific analysis and accountability, and supporting regulatory compliance and enforcement. EPA will work toward implementing key initiatives under EO 13508, including: implementing the TMDL; developing a TMDL tracking and accountability system; deploying technology to integrate discrete Bay data systems and to present the data in an accessible accountability system called ChesapeakeStat; and moving forward on the Bay's challenges related to toxic contaminants. 

A centerpiece of EPA's FY 2016 activities is the implementation of the nation's largest and most complex TMDL for the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. A TMDL is essentially a plan that defines how much of a particular pollutant may be discharged into a particular waterbody while allowing the waterbody to meet its water quality standards and designated uses. EPA released the final TMDL in December 2010. Prior to that release, the Bay jurisdictions developed watershed implementation plans (WIPs) that included specific timelines for enhancing programs and implementing actions to reduce pollution. The TMDL is designed to ensure that all pollution control measures needed to fully restore the Bay and its tidal rivers are in place by 2025, with at least 60 percent of the actions completed by 2017. To support the TMDL, EPA will develop and initiate a tracking and accountability system to ensure that the Bay jurisdictions are effectively implementing the TMDL. 

To support accountability under the TMDL, EPA will enhance the Chesapeake Bay Program's water-quality monitoring network to better track TMDL progress. EPA will use its technical and scientific analysis capabilities to provide implementation support and guidance to the states and thousands of local governments that will be affected by the TMDL. EPA will assist the jurisdictions in making scientifically informed determinations of the most effective ways to meet their TMDL obligations that will provide individually tailored solutions. EPA is providing resources to expand the Partnership's existing monitoring through integration of citizen science data collection efforts of known and documented quality and other non-traditional monitoring partners (e.g., counties, municipal discharge authorities, riverkeepers, watershed organizations).

To ensure that the states are able to meet EPA's expectations under the TMDL and new national rulemakings, EPA will continue and in some cases expand its broad range of grant programs. EPA will provide funding to local governments and watershed jurisdictions through state grants based on their ability to reduce nutrient and sediment loads via key sectors such as development and agriculture in urban and rural areas. 

Ensuring that the regulated community complies with the appropriate regulations is an essential responsibility for achieving the goals established for the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. In FY 2016, the continued implementation of the Compliance and Enforcement Strategy for the Bay Watershed will target sources of pollution impairing the Bay in the watershed and airshed. EPA's multi-year, multi-state strategy combines the Agency's water, air and waste enforcement authorities to address violations of federal environmental laws resulting in nutrient, sediment, and other pollution in the Bay.","http://www.epa.gov/region03/chesapeake"

The national coordinator will provide leadership in: framing national P2 initiatives, strengthening collaboration among the regional centers, evaluating P2 information, tools and products, and marketing the centers' services nationally. 


For purposes of the grant programs, P2 is defined as any practice which reduces or eliminates the creation of pollutants through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation activities. EPA is interested in funding projects which assist in reducing hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants entering waste streams or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal. Grant activities may involve, but are not limited to the following: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, inventory control, etc.

Fiscal Year 2015: To support source reduction, pollution prevention and resource conservation activities that comply with the statutory authorities of the Clean Air Act, Section 103(b), as amended; Clean Water Act, Section 104(b)(3), as amended; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Section 20, as amended; Safe Drinking Water Act, Section 1442 (a)(1) and (c), as amended; Solid Waste Disposal Act, Section 8001(a), as amended; and the Toxic Substances Control Act, Section 10, as amended. 

Projects must consist of activities within the statutory terms of these EPA grant authorities. The statutes authorize grants for the following activities: 'research, investigations, experiments, education/training, demonstrations of new or innovative techniques, surveys and studies.' These activities relate generally to the gathering or transferring of information or advancing awareness. Applicants should emphasize this 'learning' concept in their proposals. All activities in the proposal must be eligible under one or more of the statutory authorities.

SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this 'learning' concept, as opposed to 'fixing' an environmental problem using a well-established method.

For projects that will support demonstration activity, the project must involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results of the project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration. The applicant must clearly explain in the proposal how the pollution prevention technologies, methods, or approaches used are new or experimental and how the project otherwise meets the requirements of a demonstration as described in the applicable RFP. If your project uses technologies, methods or approaches that have been used previously in other geographic areas and/or business sectors, then your proposal must include an explanation as to how your demonstration project is different from such prior projects and is a true demonstration. The applicant must also explain what will be learned in the industry from the demonstration project. If your project is truly a demonstration and complies with other eligibility factors then it will be considered for funding. 

Proposals that principally support recycling, clean-up, treatment, disposal and/or energy recovery efforts (e.g., incinerating solid waste to generate electricity) will not be considered for funding.","http://www.epa.gov/p2/pubs/grants/index.htm"

High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to states for: 1) approving specific technologies to detect leaks from tank systems; 2) ensuring that tank owners and operators are complying with notification and other requirements; 3) ensuring equipment compatibility; 4) conducting UST inspections; 5) implementing operator training; 6) prohibiting delivery for non-complying facilities; 7) seeking state program approval to operate the UST program in lieu of the Federal program; and 8) requiring secondary containment or financial responsibility for tank manufacturers and installers.

LUST Prevention assistance agreements to states and tribes, and/or intertribal consortia for activities authorized by EPAct will support states with inspections and other release prevention and compliance assurance activities for Federally-regulated UST systems, as well as for enforcement activities related to release prevention. A main cause of releases is the lack of proper operation and maintenance of UST systems, which is why the EPA proposed revisions to the UST regulations in FY 2012 that address these and other important issues. Any changes that result from a final rule will require subsequent state adoption, applicable updates to state regulations, and updates to state program approval. 

For tribes, the LUST Prevention assistance agreements will assist with all aspects of the Tribal programs, e.g., inspection capacity. High priority tasks include providing financial assistance to states and tribes for: 1) inspecting UST facilities to complete the three-year inspection requirement; 2) developing inspection capacity for Tribes; 3) assisting states in adopting measures (e.g., delivery prohibition, secondary containment, operator training, etc.), as required by EPAct and EPA's grant guidelines; 4) enforcement activities related to release prevention; 5) development of leak prevention regulations and other program infrastructure; 6) helping tribes develop the capacity to administer UST programs, such as providing funding to support training for Tribal staff and educating owners and operators in Indian Country about UST requirements. These activities are geared toward bringing all UST systems into compliance with release detection and release prevention requirements and minimizing future releases. Priority will be given to providing funds to enable the States to meet their responsibilities under Title XV, Subtitle B of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. States that have entered into assistance agreements with EPA must have the authority to inspect and take other compliance and related enforcement actions to prevent releases from USTs.

These R&DT projects are targeted at high priority technical issues, gaps, operations, or safety concerns to clean up the Nation\x92s legacy of defense-related radioactive wastes. The technologies developed in this R&DT program will identify or improve the current waste treatment baseline, develop new or augmented cost-effective technologies or methods, provide advanced technologies/ methods for insertion into new or existing waste treatment facilities/ infrastructures, address known technology gaps, and reduce project technical risk and uncertainty. This meets the Departmental goal to accelerate waste treatment, clean-up, and provide risk reduction to the public. For example, R&DT for High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are needed to improve the performance and validation of currently available HEPA filters in upset conditions (e.g.  fires).  In addition, R&DT into HEPA  filters under various normal and upset test conditions will help determine valuable operational information (i.e., develop suggested controls and operational methods, and identify failure modes) that can be applied at various commercial and Government/military facilities that treat, store, or process nuclear material or waste streams (e.g. commercial nuclear power facilities), or filter out hazardous particulates or dust for commercial microelectronic clean rooms or hospital operations.  This research and testing may increase the protective nature of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) AG-1 Code (Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment), enhance the ability of professionals to design filters and air filtration systems, and reduce uncertainty in the development of standard operating procedures for facilities involved in nuclear containment ventilation activities.

"1786",1786,"93.213","Research and Training in Complementary and Integrative Health","National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health","To evaluate  complementary health approaches.  The following objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the Center's National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and practice.

Research Approaches
Basic, translational, efficacy and effectiveness research
Complementary health approaches need to be studied across the continuum of basic, translational, efficacy, and effectiveness research.  NCCIH continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; NCCIH's basic research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design and implement definitive clinical research and 'real world' outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.
NCCIH\x92s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.
NCCIH's clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control, observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches . The clinical research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced in 'real-world' settings.
In general phase III clinical trials will be supported under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff. Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)
Areas of Special Interest
Fundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms. One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action of natural products including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota naturally present in the human body. Another key goal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms through which mind and body approaches such as meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and acupuncture affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   A third key goal is to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established methodology. NCCIH will also support studies in 'real world' clinical settings to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their integration into health care. Individual behavior plays a key role in health promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors (diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  
Top Scientific Priorities
The top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond. Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest. Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion and disease prevention across the lifespan.
Early Stage and New Investigators
NCCIH is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g., R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds, NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles or scores out of  payline order.

NCCIH continues to accept applications in areas not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities.

The four Objectives of the Plan describe the continuum of mental health research, ranging from understanding basic pathophysiology, to defining the trajectories of mental illnesses, to developing innovative treatment and prevention strategies, to ensuring public health impact.  The Institute\x92s overall funding strategy is to support a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public health impact is a short-term measure of success.  

Cross-cutting themes relevant to all research supported by NIMH include the Research Domain Criteria Initiative; the Institute\x92s new experimental medicine approach, which focuses on studies with defined targets and milestones; the role of the environment in the pathogenesis of mental illnesses; the new culture of open science with broad and rapid data sharing; preemptive medicine; research designed to reduce and eliminate mental health disparities both within and outside the United States \x96 specifically, research on sex, gender, age, racial, and ethics differences related to mental illnesses; partnerships with external stakeholders; and, supporting and training future generations of mental health researchers. 

Specific program objectives include:

To determine the molecular, cellular, and systems components underlying brain connectivity and dynamic patterns of brain activity using model systems, and human studies; to identify the mechanisms responsible for establishing and maintaining circuits; to identify and validate novel assays to quantify changes in the activity of molecules, cells, and circuits; and, to elucidate the basic biology linking changes in molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-based targets to alterations in complex behaviors.

To define genomic variations associated with mental illnesses and determine the biological consequences of these variations; to define the molecular mechanisms that determine how experience has enduring effects on gene expression, brain function, and behavior; to delineate environmental and biological factors altering genomic risk for mental illnesses; and, to develop analytical tools for multi-scale data integration.

To identify cells and brain networks that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction, such as cognition, emotion, and social behavior; to determine how changes in the physiological properties of molecules, cells, and circuits contribute to mental illnesses; to develop biomarkers of impaired neural function in humans at the level of molecules, cells, and circuits; and, to develop innovative technologies, as well as new pharmacological and genetic tools, to interrogate and modulate the signaling pathways and circuits altered by mental illnesses.

To characterize developmental processes across biological and behavioral domains of analysis that give rise to mental illnesses throughout the lifespan; to identify sensitive periods for typical and atypical mental health trajectories; and, to determine modifiers of maturational and illness trajectories, emphasizing periods of sensitivity to perturbation and/or potential for intervention.

To identify early biological and environmental risk and protective factors and their underlying mechanisms to serve as novel intervention targets; and, to develop biomarkers and assessment tools to predict illness onset, course, and intervention response across diverse populations.   

To identify and validate new targets for treatment development that underlie disease mechanisms; to develop and validate new metrics for target engagement that are feasible for use in clinical trials; and, to develop objective surrogate measures of outcome and clinical change that extend beyond symptoms, to assess if target mechanisms underlying general health and quality of life have been modified by treatments.

To develop valid and innovative biomarkers to detect subgroups of individuals sharing common etiologies \x96 whether within or across traditional diagnostic categories \x96 as well as aspects of emotion, cognition, and social behavior that predict clinical response; to foster personalized interventions and strategies for sequencing or combining existing and novel interventions that are optimal for specific phases of disease progression (e.g., prodromal, initial-onset, chronic), different stages of development (e.g., early childhood, adolescence, adulthood, late life), and other individual characteristics; and, to develop and refine alternative research designs and analytic approaches that can be used to test precise interventions.

To develop and test bundled intervention components (each validated individually in prior research) that have the greatest impact on patients\x92 lives and functioning; together with key stakeholders, including patient, provider, payer, and other research funding groups, to conduct efficient pragmatic trials that employ new tools to rapidly identify, engage, assess, and follow participants in the context of routine care; and, to enhance the practical relevance of effectiveness research, taking into account how patient-, provider-, and organizational-level factors impact the outcomes of interventions in practice settings.

To employ existing real-world data collection systems to identify strategies for improving access, quality, and equity of mental health services in diverse populations; to identify, validate, and scale-up innovative programs currently in use that improve mental health services for underserved populations; to optimize financing models for adults and children with serious mental illnesses to provide efficient and effective care in public and private health care systems.

In partnership with key stakeholders, to develop and validate strategies for implementing, sustaining, and continuously improving evidence-based practices; to build models to scale-up effective interventions for use in public and private primary care, specialty care, and other systems; and, to develop decision support tools that increase the effectiveness and continuous improvement of mental health interventions in public and private primary care, specialty care, and other systems.

To develop systems-level strategies in non-traditional mental health settings, using technology and other approaches, to identify, support, and monitor the effectiveness of care for individuals with mental illnesses; to develop and validate service delivery models that provide responsive and pre-emptive evidence-based supports for individuals throughout the course of illness; and, to develop and validate coordinated medical decision-making models that bridge multiple social and medical care settings to integrate the appropriate care for people with serious mental illnesses and multiple chronic conditions.

To develop assessment platforms within service systems that allow ongoing monitoring of mental illness prevalence, service access, quality, efficiency of care, and outcomes for people with mental illnesses; and, develop valid and reliable measures of treatment quality and outcomes that can be feasibly applied at the person, clinic, system, and population levels.

To expand approaches to integrate behavioral science with effective biomedical strategies for HIV prevention; to advance the development and testing of interventions delivered beyond the individual level, by incorporating appropriate context into intervention development and testing; to increase intervention potency and long-term maintenance of effects, with an emphasis on targeting high-risk vulnerable populations; to develop strategies to increase HIV-testing and improve linkage to care and timely treatment initiation; to develop and test interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes through optimal treatment adherence and sustained engagement in care; and, to support implementation science and operations research to enhance dissemination strategies and public health impact of effective interventions.

To examine evolving pathophysiologic mechanisms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in the setting of long-term antiretroviral therapy, and development of novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate CNS complications of HIV infection; to support the use of state-of-the-art genetic approaches to identify and validate viral and host genetic factors that influence the pathophysiology of HAND; and, to define and characterize HIV persistence in the CNS in the context of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy, and foster translational research to enable therapeutic eradication of HIV-1 from the brain.","http://www.nimh.nih.gov"

Congress authorized AI/ANs to have access to Medicare and Medicaid services when provided through Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities located in tribal communities and amended titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit IHS facilities to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to eligible AI/ANs. This authority was later extended to tribal facilities.  Congress has also provided authority for Indian health care programs and beneficiaries to participate in the Children\x92s Health Insurance program and the Health Insurance Marketplace.  
These changes have created a direct relationship between CMS and the Indian Health Service, The research conducted under this cooperative agreement is needed to help improve administration of CMS\x92 programs given that CMS and IHS programs operate under different and sometimes competing authorities for CMS\x92 programs, the Social Security Act and for IHS\x92 programs, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the Indian Self Determination Education and Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638. To make CMS\x92 programs work with Indian health program authorities, a crucial first is step is for CMS to understand the impact of its policies on Indian health care providers and tribal members so that the agency can provide the AI/AN community greater access to CMS\x92 programs  in an effective and efficient manner.  

The authority at Section 1110 of the Social Security Act permits CMS to enter into grants andcooperative arrangements with organizations and certain other entities in order to aid in improving administration and effectiveness of programs administered by the agency. To this end, the work conducted under this cooperative agreement will address the potential and actual impacts of CMS\x92 programs on AI/ANs and the health care system serving these beneficiaries. CMS\x92 understanding of the impact of its policies is vital to improving greater AI/AN access to and participation in CMS\x92 programs; improving and ensuring that appropriate health care payments and resources are provided to IHS  tribal, and urban Indian Health program providers; and contributing to overall improved health outcomes for Indian people.  The information and activities produced  or provided under the cooperative agreement will be used to develop culturally appropriate activities and strategies to improve how CMS\x92 program operate and are administered in Indian country.","http://www.nihb.org"

"1885",1885,"93.361","Nursing Research","","The mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. To achieve this mission, NINR supports and conducts clinical and basic research and research training on health and illness, research that spans and integrates the behavioral and biological sciences, and that develops the scientific basis for clinical practice. From premature infants in neonatal intensive care units, to adolescents living with diabetes, to elderly cancer survivors coping with pain, nursing research develops the science to help people strengthen the quality of their lives.  Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR\x92s scientific programs are organized around four major focus areas: symptom science, wellness, self-management of chronic conditions, and the science of end-of-life and palliative care. The Institute also explores ways in which new innovations and technologies can contribute to advancing nursing science across these four areas. In addition, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future. NINR\x92s research program in symptom science seeks a better understanding of the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms, with the goal of developing and testing new interventions to reduce the disabling effects of symptoms and improving patient health outcomes and quality of life. Research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR research in self-management seeks to engage individuals and families as active participants in maintaining and improving quality of life while living with a chronic condition or multiple chronic conditions. Self-management research encompasses health strategies that allow an individual and their health care provider to adapt treatments to individual circumstances. As the lead NIH Institute for end-of-life research, NINR supports science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing the symptoms of advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. NINR also recognizes that high-quality, evidence-based palliative care is a critical component of maintaining quality of life at any stage of illness, not limited to the end of life. In focusing on innovation and technology, NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and communities. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality health care. NINR supports individual and institutional pre- and postdoctoral research fellowships, as well as career development awards, and sponsors numerous \x91research intensives\x92 for nurse scientists at all career levels. NINR\x92s Division of Intramural Research conducts basic and clinical research on the interactions among molecular mechanisms underlying symptoms and environmental influences on individual health outcomes. The program focuses on the biological and behavioral underpinnings of symptoms of chronic conditions, including digestive disorders, cancer-related fatigue, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as clinical interventions to alleviate symptoms.","http://www.ninr.nih.gov/"

The IHS Sanitation Facilities Construction Program, an integral component of the IHS disease prevention activity, has carried out those authorities since 1960 using funds appropriated for Sanitation Facilities Construction to provide potable water and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people.  As a result, the rates for infant mortality, the mortality rate for gastroenteritis and other environmentally related diseases have been dramatically reduced, by about 80 percent since 1973.  The IHS physicians and health professionals credit many of these health status improvements to IHS' provision of water supplies, sewage disposal facilities, development of solid waste sites, and provision of technical assistance to Indian water and sewer utility organizations. The provision of Indian sanitation facilities is a very important component of the overall effort required to achieve a reduction in waterborne disease outbreaks, a goal highlighted in Healthy People 2020 'Topics & Objectives\x94 for Environmental Health.

As a block grant, CCDF gives funding to states, territories, and tribes to provide child care subsidies through grants and contracts with providers, as well as vouchers or certificates to low-income families. CCDF is a dual purpose program with a two-generational impact. CCDF provides access to child care services for low-income families so they can work, attend school, or enroll in training to improve the well-being of their families. At the same time, it also promotes the healthy development and school success of our nation\x92s low- and moderate-income children by providing them with higher-quality early learning and afterschool experiences. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is the discretionary portion of the CCDF program .CCDBG was created under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and is subject to annual appropriations. In 2014, Congress acted on a bipartisan basis to pass the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-186) into law and reauthorizes the CCDF program for the first time since 1996.  The CCDBG Act of 2014 renews authority for the CCDF program through FY 2020 and represents an historic re-envisioning of the CCDF program. The new law makes significant advancements by defining health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlining family-friendly eligibility policies, and ensuring parents and the general public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. The Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds (see CFDA 93.596)  is the entitlement portion of the CCDF program , which consists of \x93matching funds,\x94 that require a state match and maintenance of effort, and \x93mandatory funds.\x94 Entitlement funds are made available under section 418 of the Social Security Act. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) consolidated funding for child care under section 418 of the Social Security Act and made such funding subject to the requirements of the CCDBG Act, as amended.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designated the combined entitlement and discretionary funding as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program.
The new purposes of the CCDF program are to: 1) allow each State maximum flexibility in developing child care programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within that State; (2) promote parental choice to empower working parents to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suits their family\x92s needs; (3) encourage States to provide consumer education information to help parents make informed choices about child care services and to promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings; (4) assist States in delivering high-quality, coordinated early childhood care and education services to maximize parents\x92 options and support parents trying to achieve independence from public assistance; (5) assist States in improving the overall quality of child care services and programs by implementing the health, safety, licensing, training, and oversight standards established in this subchapter and in State law (including State regulations); (6) improve child care and development of participating children; and (7) increase the number and percentage of low-income children in high-quality child care settings.","http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ"

"1975",1975,"93.596","Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds of the Child Care and Development Fund","Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)","The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary federal funding source dedicated to providing child care assistance to low-income families. As a block grant, CCDF gives funding to states, territories, and tribes to provide child care subsidies through grants and contracts with providers, as well as vouchers or certificates to low-income families. CCDF is a dual purpose program with a two-generational impact. CCDF provides access to child care services for low-income families so they can work, attend school, or enroll in training to improve the well-being of their families. At the same time, it also promotes the healthy development and school success of our nation\x92s low- and moderate-income children by providing them with higher-quality early learning and afterschool experiences.
The Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds  is the mandatory portion of the CCDF program , which consists of \x93matching funds,\x94 that require a state match and maintenance of effort, and \x93mandatory funds.\x94. These funds are made available under section 418 of the Social Security Act. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) consolidated funding for child care under section 418 of the Social Security Act and made such funding subject to the requirements of the CCDBG Act, as amended.  The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is the discretionary portion of  the CCDF program (see CFDA 93.575) , CCDBG was  created  under  the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and is subject to annual appropriations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designated the combined entitlement and discretionary funding as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program.
In 2014, Congress acted on a bipartisan basis to pass the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-186 ) into law and reauthorizes the CCDF program for the first time since 1996.  The CCDBG Act of 2014 renews authority for CCDF program through FY 2020 and represents an historic re-envisioning of the program. The new law makes significant advancements by defining health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlining family-friendly eligibility policies, and ensuring parents and the general public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. 
The new purposes of the CCDF program are to: 1) allow each State maximum flexibility in developing child care programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within that State; (2) promote parental choice to empower working parents to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suits their family\x92s needs; (3) encourage States to provide consumer education information to help parents make informed choices about child care services and to promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings; (4) assist States in delivering high-quality, coordinated early childhood care and education services to maximize parents\x92 options and support parents trying to achieve independence from public assistance; (5) assist States in improving the overall quality of child care services and programs by implementing the health, safety, licensing, training, and oversight standards established in this subchapter and in State law (including State regulations); (6) improve child care and development of participating children; and (7) increase the number and percentage of low-income children in high-quality child care settings.","http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ"

"1987",1987,"93.610","Health Care Innovation Awards (HCIA)","","The first round of the Health Innovation Awards (HCIA), announced on November 14, 2011, was a broad solicitation in which CMS welcomed a wide variety of proposals.  In HCIA, Round One, CMS funded 107 Awardees who proposed compelling new models of service delivery/ payment improvements that showed substantial promise of delivering the Three-Part Aim of better health, better health care, and lower costs through improved quality for Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\x92s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries. Successful models included plans to rapidly develop and/or deploy the requisite workforce to support the proposed model. Awards recognized interventions that showed capability to improve care within the first 6 months of the award, while creating a sustainable pathway to net Medicare/Medicaid/CHIP savings within two to three years.  These models of service delivery and payment improvement are now entering Year Two of the three-year period of performance for Round One of the HCIA.
A second round of the Health Care Innovation Awards (HCIA) was announced on May 15, 2013.  In HCIA Round Two, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will fund applicants who propose new service delivery models and design corresponding new payment models that show promise of providing better health, better health care, and lower costs through improved quality for Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\x92s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollees.
In Round Two, CMS is specifically seeking new payment and service delivery models in four broad Innovation Categories, as follows: 
\x95	Models that are designed to rapidly reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP costs in outpatient and/or post-acute settings.  Priority areas are diagnostic services, outpatient radiology, high-cost physician-administered drugs, home based services, therapeutic services, and post-acute services. While preference will be given to submissions within these priority areas, CMS will consider submissions in other outpatient and/or post-acute areas within this Category.
\x95	Models that improve care for populations with specialized needs.  Priority areas are high-cost pediatric populations, children in foster care, children at high risk for dental disease, adolescents in crisis, persons with Alzheimer\x92s disease, persons living with HIV/AIDS (in particular, efforts to link and retain patients in care and improve medication adherence that lead to viral suppression), persons requiring long-term support and services, and persons with serious behavioral health needs.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions that improve care for other populations with specialized needs.
\x95	Models that test approaches for specific types of providers to transform their financial and clinical models.  Priority areas are models designed for physician specialties and subspecialties (for example, oncology and cardiology), and for pediatric providers who provide services to children with complex medical issues (including but not limited to care for children with multiple medical conditions, behavioral health issues, congenital disease, chronic respiratory disease, and complex social issues); and that include, as appropriate, shared decision-making mechanisms to engage beneficiaries and their families and/or caregivers in treatment choices.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions in other areas within this Category and from other specific types of non-physician providers.
\x95	Models that improve the health of populations \x96 defined geographically (health of a community), clinically (health of those with specific diseases), or by socioeconomic class \x96 through activities focused on engaging beneficiaries, prevention (for example, a diabetes prevention program or a hypertension prevention program), wellness, and comprehensive care that extend beyond the clinical service delivery setting.  These models may include community based organizations or coalitions and may leverage community health improvement efforts.  These models must have a direct link to improving the quality and reducing the costs of care for Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP beneficiaries. Priority areas are: models that lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and HIV/AIDS; models that promote behaviors that reduce risk for chronic disease, including increased physical activity and improved nutrition; models that promote medication adherence and self-management skills; models that prevent falls among older adults; and broader models that link clinical care with community-based interventions.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions in other areas within this Category.
These categories were identified as gaps in the current Innovation Center portfolio and as areas that could result in potentially usable models for changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment methods.  This round of Innovation Awards encourages a strong focus on Medicaid and CHIP populations.  In addition, models that primarily focus on acute hospital inpatient care are excluded from this round and will not be reviewed. (Hospitals are eligible to apply for awards if they propose a model within one of the four Innovation Categories described below.)
In Round Two \x96 in contrast to the first round \x96 CMS specifically seeks new payment models to support the service delivery models funded by this initiative.
Awardees will be required to implement the service delivery models at the start of the three-year cooperative agreement period and submit a fully developed new Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP payment model by the end of the cooperative agreement period.  Successful applicants will demonstrate that they can implement a model that improves quality of care and reduces cost within the first six months of the award and delivers net savings to CMS within three years.  At its discretion and consistent with the requirements of Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, CMS may further develop one or more of these payment and service delivery models and open them to participation through a subsequent solicitation.

"2011",2011,"93.646","ACA \x96 Testing a Model of Data Aggregation under the Comprehensive Primary Care initiative","","The Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative is a multi-payer initiative fostering collaboration between public and private health insurance companies (\x93payers\x94) to strengthen primary care.  Recognizing that the impact of any one payer alone is limited, the payers in CPC have committed to establishing an approach that is coordinated with that of the Innovation Center to transform the way in which primary care is practiced and financially supported.  

In May-July 2012, the Innovation Center executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each participating payer.  One of the stated goals in the MOU is improving the flow of cost and utilization data to CPC primary care practices to support practices in their efforts to improve outcomes through care coordination and quality improvement.  The MOU described a collaboration by which each regional group of payers \x96 with CMS\x92 input \x96 would produce a written plan \x93that outlines how participating payers will transition to a common approach for sharing data with participating primary care practices.\x94

The MOU defined this endeavor in the following way:
. . . If an appropriately structured and protected multi-payer claims data system exists or can be created in [Market] to support a common approach for sharing data with participating primary care practices, the Innovation Center and [payer] will submit its data to the system.

In order to improve care coordination and support practices to provide better patient care, payers have agreed to work together to improve data-sharing to practices. The goal of data aggregation is to combine patient-level cost and utilization data from all payers in a uniform and actionable format so that physicians can better coordinate care across their entire population. This data will help CPC primary care practices deliver better care to their patients by providing information to support their efforts to improve care outcomes through care coordination and quality improvement.  CPC practices have been asking for this data to be aggregated for their practice rather than to receive it individually from each payer, which has been cumbersome and less useful for them in managing the health of their patients.  Payers in four CPC regions have been delivering data in this format, but Medicare data has not to date been included.  

The purpose of this program is to support vendors in four CPC regions to combine Medicare claims data with claims data from other commercial payers in each respective region and create actionable feedback reports for practices to improve care coordination and population health, and decrease costs.  The end-users of this aggregated data are the CPC practices; including Medicare data in this demonstration is central to the stated goal of improving care coordination by providing actionable data to primary care practices.  We are proposing to add Medicare data in CPC regions with existing multi-payer databases to test a model of data aggregation within the CPC initiative to better understand how Medicare data may be incorporated and used by practices to improve care coordination and quality improvement.  The activities funded by these cooperative agreements are projected to run for the duration of the CPC initiative, currently scheduled to end December 31, 2016.  

Specifically, these cooperative agreements are intended for vendors in four CPC regions:
	\x95	Taconic Health Information Network Community (THINC) in the Capital-District Hudson Valley region of New York;
	\x95	The Health Collaborative in the Cincinnati-Dayton region of southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky;
	\x95	MyHealth in the greater Tulsa region of Oklahoma; and 
	\x95	Rise Health in Colorado

The CPC payers in each region have selected the vendors listed above as their data aggregation vendors and have asked CMS to provide Medicare data to these vendors to be included in these existing multi-payer databases.  Each group of regional payers is structuring their data aggregation system independently (i.e. these efforts are not connected across regions). Each group of regional payers has already entered into contractual relationships with their respective vendors.  The data aggregation vendors, the intended awardees for these cooperative agreements, are establishing multi-payer claims databases specific to the payer data for the CPC practices in their geopgraphic region. CMS participation in the data aggregation initiative will pay for Medicare data to be incorporated into the multi-payer databases serving CPC practices in each respective region (New York, Ohio/Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Colorado).","http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/comprehensive-primary-care-initiative/"

"2015",2015,"93.650","Accountable Health Communities ","AHC ","The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (the Innovation Center), will assess whether systematically identifying the health-related social needs of community-dwelling Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, including those who are dually eligible, and addressing their identified needs impacts those beneficiaries\x92 total health care costs and their inpatient and outpatient utilization.  
The Section 3021 provisions of the ACA authorize the Innovation Center to design, implement and evaluate innovative payment and service delivery models to improve quality and reduce costs.  Rigorous evaluation requirements of the model\x92s impact influence model design parameters.  

The Accountable Health Communities (AHC) Model is based on emerging evidence that addressing health-related social needs through enhanced clinical-community linkages can improve health outcomes and reduce costs. This model will support community collaboration to systematically: (1) screen beneficiaries to identify unmet health-related social needs; (2) refer beneficiaries to increase awareness of community services; (3) provide person-centered navigation services to assist beneficiaries with accessing community services; and (4) align clinical and community services to ensure that community services are available and responsive to the needs of beneficiaries. The expectation is that these efforts will lead to a reduction in health care utilization and costs.  
The funding announcement offers three interventions of varying intensity (each referred to as a \x93track\x94) to better link beneficiaries to community services: (1) Track 1\x97Awareness Intervention, (2) Track 2\x97Assistance Intervention, and (3) Track 3\x97Alignment Intervention.  Prospective applicants may apply to up to two tracks (i.e., Tracks 1 and 2, Tracks 2 and 3, or Tracks 1 and 3). The Track 1\x97Awareness Intervention tests whether increasing beneficiary awareness of available community services through information dissemination and referral  impacts total health care costs and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization of high-risk beneficiaries. Track 2\x97Assistance Intervention will test whether assisting beneficiaries with accessing services through community service navigation impacts total health care cost and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization.   This intervention incorporates innovations from Track 1 (universal screening of health-related social needs and use of a community resource inventory to connect beneficiaries to available community services) with two additional features: (1) identifying high-risk beneficiaries as part of a smarter spending strategy to target additional resources where they are needed the most; and (2) community service navigation to assist high risk beneficiaries with resolving health-related social needs.  Track 3\x97Alignment Intervention tests whether a combination of navigation services at the individual beneficiary level and partner alignment at the community level impacts ED visits and inpatient hospital admissions.  This approach recognizes that there are significant barriers to effective integration of the health care delivery systems, governmental public health systems, and the community-based service system due to different cultures, funding streams and data systems.  Effective and responsive infrastructures are needed to ensure that community services are available and address the health-related social needs of beneficiaries.  This intervention incorporates innovations included in Tracks 1 and 2 and adds structural and financial support designed to foster community-wide realignment of resources to more effectively address beneficiaries\x92 health-related social needs. 
Successful applicants will be selected to participate in a single track for the entire 5-year period.  Although tracks share common design elements, each track\x92s intervention pathway and underlying hypothesis is distinct. Each track will be tested over a 5-year period.","http://www.innovation.cms.gov"

The CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) is a public-private partnership of community organizations, private insurers, employers, health care organizations, and government agencies working to deliver the type 2 diabetes prevention lifestyle change program.  It is an innovative example of linking the community and clinical sectors to cost-effectively improve health outcomes. The National DPP is focused on aligning incentives since third-party payers reimburse for health outcomes. Economic studies indicate that lifestyle change programs (costing about $400 per person) are cost effective and even cost saving by reducing the cost of treating diabetes and its complications prevented by the program.  These favorable costs are the result of employing a lower cost workforce, delivering the program in groups, and consistency in program content. The award recipients will be expected to develop, implement, market, and evaluate a comprehensive plan for scaling the National DPP lifestyle change program in select communities.  The awardees will identify and engage organizations and/or employers that have capacity to offer the National DPP lifestyle change program and facilitate the establishment of the National DPP lifestyle change program, in collaboration with these organizations and/or employers.

MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their choice (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions, and (4) put procedures in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS.  The demonstration provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 90 consecutive days. However, days that an individual was residing in the institution for the sole purpose of receiving short-term rehabilitation services that are reimbursed under Medicare are excluded and will not be counted toward the 90-day requirement. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible.  Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with a 'qualified HCBS program' which is a program that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition. States will be required to participate in a national qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted by CMS. Data collected on a national level will help evaluate the core objectives of the statute.","https://www.cms.gov/CommunityServices/20_MFP.asp"

There are currently three provider-based networks established through CDC\x92s EISN cooperative agreement programs: 1) Surveillance network of infectious disease specialists, 2) Global surveillance network of travel medicine clinics, and 3) Emergency department-based network of academically affiliated emergency departments for research on emerging infectious diseases.  The first two networks (infectious disease specialists and travel medicine clinics) are non-research programs, and the third network (academically affiliated EDs) is a research program. These networks contribute to surveillance for emerging infectious diseases, including drug resistant, foodborne and waterborne, and vaccine-preventable or potentially vaccine-preventable diseases, and enhance information exchange leading to early identification of and response to trends and outbreaks. 
Objectives for the provider-based sentinel networks include the following:
-	To support linked groups of participating individuals or organizations in monitoring a variety of infectious disease problems and enhancing communication and collaboration among network members and the public health community;
-	To serve as readily accessible mechanisms to address urgent public health infectious disease problems rapidly; and
-	To improve understanding of specific public health issues, including, but not limited to, international travel, and enhance preparedness to meet new infectious disease threats among domestic and globally mobile populations.

\x95	Improve effective delivery and use of quality clinical and other preventive services aimed at preventing and managing diabetes and hypertension; and
\x95	Increase community-clinical linkages to support prevention, self-management, and control of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.  
Long Term Goals:
\x95	Improved prevention and control of hypertension
\x95	Improved prevention and control of diabetes
\x95	Improved prevention and control of overweight and obesity

The FOA has two components: 1) A basic non-competitive component to support health promotion, epidemiology, and surveillance activities and targeted strategies that will result in measurable impacts to address school health, nutrition and physical activity risk factors, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease and stroke prevention in all 50 states and the District of Columbia  These efforts will be supported by core public health activities such as partnership engagement, workforce development, guidance and support for programmatic efforts, strategic communication, surveillance and epidemiology, and evaluation; and 2)  A competitive enhanced component to build on and extend the activities supported with basic funding to achieve even greater reach and impact.  Thirty-two states were funded under the enhanced Component to implement evidence and practice-based interventions to improve physical activity and nutrition, reduce obesity, and prevent and control diabetes, heart disease, and stroke with a focus on high blood pressure.  The enhanced component includes implementation of evidence-based strategies that are more extensive and wider-reaching than those implemented in the basic component.  States funded for this enhanced component must implement interventions at scale in order to reach large segments of the population in the state (e.g., through school districts, early care and education (ECEs), worksites, and state and local governmental agencies) and in partnership with organizations that may or may not have worked with state departments of health in the past (e.g., large employers, public housing, the education sector, health insurers, and large health systems).","http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp."

This overarching programmatic goal of building state and local capabilities will be achieved through various means and methods, each one aimed at making achieving the National Preparedness Goal and furthering our collective efforts to remain a safe and secure nation. 
Specific program activities anticipated for achieving this goal will include, but will not be limited to: 

\x95 production and dissemination of written products relating to emerging homeland security issues and established or model state homeland security efforts; 
\x95 providing educational seminars for apprising newly appointed Governor\x92s Homeland Security Advisors of federal homeland security doctrine, best-practices and established principles; 
\x95 facilitating calls, meetings, or discussions amongst representatives from key stakeholder groups on a regular basis which serve to share information, knowledge, experiences, and practices relating to current and emerging homeland security issues; and, 
\x95 convening trainings, workshops, and other meeting opportunities designed to bring together in a common forum nationwide HSAs, state, local and tribal Emergency Management Directors, as well as other professional organizations in the public and private sectors and to inform partners on the impacts of federal homeland security legislation, regulations and policies on the states. 

Each recipient will conduct these specific activities to support either State Emergency Management Directors, Homeland Security Advisors to further build State, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) capabilities. 
An additional key purpose for the HSPTAP is that the program also furthers the building of a national system of emergency management capabilities that can effectively and efficiently utilize the full measure of the Nation's resources to respond to catastrophic incidents, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made emergencies or events. HSPTAP recipients will conduct activities that bring together the collective perspectives of state and local elected officials and the private sector to provide a broad-based sounding board on homeland security issues for all national stakeholders. The program will serve to establish, provide, and maintain a forum for organizations to exchange ideas, conduct targeted discussions, as well as to provide technical assistance to governors\x92 offices, associations and organizations on all relevant homeland security policy areas. 

Finally, HSPTAP will engage the recipient organizations which can work closely with FEMA to develop, transfer, and institutionalize pertinent knowledge at the State and local level for addressing current public policy challenges facing State EM Directors, HSAs and other state and local emergency management officials. HSPTAP recipients, through collaboration with FEMA and other national, regional, state and local entities, will facilitate focused and enhanced communication and coordination among all disciplines and levels of government to address the complex challenges of developing and implementing homeland security policies and practices including: intelligence sharing; State homeland security organization, structure and governance; communications interoperability; critical infrastructure protection; and all hazards disaster prevention, protection, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to include areas of emergency management, homeland security, fire, law enforcement, Emergency Management Services (EMS), agriculture, National Guard, emergency communications, and public works. 
In sum, in addition to building state and local capabilities, the activities conducted under the HSPTAP are structured to address the full spectrum of mission areas, national priorities, and core capabilities outlined in the National Preparedness System and are critical to achieving the National Preparedness Goal.

"2247",2247,"97.045","Cooperating Technical Partners","(CTP)","The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program exists to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through fostering strong Federal, State, Tribal, regional and local partnerships to reduce flood losses and promote community resiliency. The CTP Program supports Strengthening National Preparedness and Resilience, one of five basic missions of the DHS2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. Additionally, the program supports the National Mitigation Framework within the Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-8). 
The objectives of the CTP Program primarily support the mission and objectives of the NFIP\x92s Flood Hazard Mapping Program through FEMA\x92s flood hazard identification and assessment programs including the Risk MAP (Mapping, Assessment, and Planning) initiative. The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness of flood hazard risk and leads to action that reduces flood risk to life and property. Risk MAP develops flood hazard data and maps for communities that have never had identified risks as well as building on effective flood hazard data and flood insurance rate maps. FEMA collaborates with a variety of stakeholders to achieve the following goals under Risk MAP:

\x95	Flood Hazard Data- Address gaps in flood hazard data to form a solid foundation for risk assessment, floodplain management, and actuarial soundness of the NFIP.
\x95	Public Awareness/Outreach- Ensure that a measurable increase of the public\x92s awareness and understanding of risk results in a measurable reduction of current and future vulnerability.
\x95	Hazard Mitigation Planning- Lead and support States, local, and Tribal communities to effectively engage in risk-based mitigation planning resulting in sustainable actions that reduce or eliminate risks to life and property from natural hazards.
\x95	Enhanced Digital Platform- Provide an enhanced digital platform that improves management of Risk MAP, steward of information produced by Risk MAP, and improves communication and sharing of risk data and related products to all levels of government and the public.
\x95	Alignment and Synergies- Align Risk Analysis programs and develop synergies to enhance decision-making capabilities through effective risk communication and management.

Information about Risk MAP (including goals, strategies, progress and success stories), can be found on FEMA\x92s website at http://www.fema.gov/risk-mapping-assessment-planning.

FEMA through the CTP Program seeks to build upon and enhance the existing capabilities of CTPs to increase local involvement in, and ownership of flood hazard identification, flood map maintenance, risk assessment, and risk communication to encourage responsible floodplain management and support their jurisdictional responsibilities as participating members of the NFIP.  They assist in the development and maintenance of flood risk data and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and other risk related products, as well as other assistance in advancing their local and FEMA\x92s goals and objectives of Risk MAP and the NFIP program. Partnerships developed through FEMA\x92s CTP Program are in the best interest of State and local communities, the NFIP and the general public. FEMA is responsible for establishing and updating minimum Federal criteria and holds the final decision making responsibility for issuing the FIRMs and any revisions/updates, however, there are several mutually beneficial reasons for creating these partnerships to help produce risk identification and assessment data, and other products in support of the NFIP.","http://fema.gov"

FY 2016 HSGP provides funding directly to eligible tribes to help strengthen the nation against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks. The FY 2016 HSGP is comprised of four interconnected grant programs:
\x95	State Homeland Security Program (SHSP):
\x95	Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP):
\x95	Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI):
\x95	Operation Stonegarden (OPSG):

State Homeland Security Program (SHSP): The SHSP assists state, Tribal and local preparedness activities that address high-priority preparedness gaps across all core capabilities where a nexus to terrorism exists.  All supported investments are based on capability targets and gaps identified during the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process, and assessed in the State Preparedness Report (SPR).   

Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP): The Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 THSGP plays an important role in the implementation of the National Preparedness System by supporting the building, sustainment, and delivery of core capabilities essential to achieving the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) of a secure and resilient Nation. Delivering core capabilities requires the combined effort of the whole community, rather than the exclusive effort of any single organization or level of government. The FY 2016 THSGP\x92s allowable costs support efforts to build and sustain core capabilities across the Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery mission areas.

Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI): The UASI Program assists high-threat, high-density Urban Areas in efforts to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism.
 
Operation Stonegarden (OPSG):  The OPSG Program supports enhanced cooperation and coordination among Customs and Border Protection (CBP), United States Border Patrol (USBP), and local, Tribal, territorial, state, and Federal law enforcement agencies.  The OPSG Program funds investments in joint efforts to secure the United States\x92 borders along routes of ingress from international borders to include travel corridors in states bordering Mexico and Canada, as well as states and territories with international water borders.

All four programs are based on risk-driven, capabilities-based strategic plans that outline high-priority needs relating to terrorism preparedness.  For these plans to be effective, government officials and elected leaders, working with the whole community, must consider how to sustain current capability levels, while also addressing potential gaps.

The National Preparedness System is the instrument the Nation employs to build, sustain, and deliver core capabilities in order to achieve the Goal of a secure and resilient Nation.  Complex and far-reaching threats and hazards require a collaborative and whole community approach to national preparedness that engages individuals, families, communities, private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based organizations, and all levels of government.  The guidance, programs, processes, and systems that support each component of the National Preparedness System allows for the integration of preparedness efforts that build, sustain, and deliver core capabilities and achieve the desired outcomes identified in the Goal.  

DHS/FEMA annually publishes the National Preparedness Report (NPR) to evaluate National progress in building, sustaining, and delivering the core capabilities outlined in the Goal.  This analysis provides a National perspective on critical preparedness trends for whole community partners to use to inform program priorities, allocate resources, and communicate with stakeholders about issues of shared concern. 

Recipients are required to consider national areas for improvement identified in the 2015 NPR, which include the following core capabilities:
\x95	Cybersecurity; 
\x95	Infrastructure Systems; 
\x95	Health and Social Services; 
\x95	Housing; and
\x95	Long-term Vulnerability Reduction.  

In addition, the Department of Homeland Security requires recipients to prioritize investments that address capability targets and gaps identified through the annual THIRA and SPR process.  These assessments set capability targets and measure current ability to meet those targets.

Minimum funding amounts are not prescribed by the Department for these priorities; however, recipients must support state, local, regional, and national efforts in achieving the desired outcomes of these priorities.","http://www.FEMA.gov/government/grant/index.shtm"

"2290",2290,"97.131","Emergency Management Baseline Assessments Grant (EMBAG)","EMBAG","The FY 2016 EMBAG Program will support the updating and enhancement of a set of American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-certified standards for emergency preparedness and response as well as a related assessment methodology for the evaluation of state, local and territorial emergency management organizations.  This assessment methodology should incorporate a peer review process that results in accreditation of the emergency management organization, regardless of size.

The assessment and accreditation of emergency management organizations against consensus-based and ANSI-certified national standards enables standardized benchmarking of critical functions necessary for an emergency management organization to build, sustain, and deliver the 31 core capabilities identified in the National Preparedness Goal. By advancing the National Preparedness Goal through ANSI-certified national standards, the EMBAG Program supports the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Mission to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience.
Accreditation based on a national standard ensures critical emergency management functions such as planning, coordination, and communications, including benchmarks for comparative evaluation.  The assessment and accreditation process empowers a jurisdiction to understand its emergency management organization\x92s capacity and shortfalls as well as develop a path for improvement.  Jurisdictions can then use the results of the assessment and accreditation process to build, sustain, and improve preparedness activities, as well as inform proposed Investment Justifications under the Homeland Security Grant Program. Tracking improvements to preparedness informs and guides development of State Preparedness Reports that serve as an essential source of information in the National Preparedness Report. 

The assessment and accreditation process supported by the Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) will include review of the following areas within an emergency management organization:
\x95	Emergency Management Program Administration, to include authorities, oversight, and strategic planning 
\x95	Emergency Management Finance 
\x95	Threat, Hazard, and Risk Identification and Assessment 
\x95	Consequence Analysis 
\x95	Hazard Mitigation 
\x95	Emergency Planning, to include mutual aid 
\x95	Incident Management 
\x95	Communications and Warning 
\x95	Operations and Procedures 
\x95	Training and Exercises 
\x95	Public Affairs
